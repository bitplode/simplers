Useful tools to make Rust easier for new developers


## Background

Many Javascript developers are increasingly interested in using Rust. They often run into some amount of confusion (and frustration) when they try to do Rust in a Javascript kind of way. The purpose of this project is to give these developers a "leg up", so to speak.

## How?

There are convenience methods that will look similar to Javascript but are written in Rust. This would allow developers to write code in a way that is more familiar to them.

## What this is Not

This is not intended to be a framework for development in Rust. Indeed, one could make the argument that developers may start by using `simplers` but then should they ought to progress onto using the idiomatic Rust way of doing things.

The sacrifice may be made for performance in certain aspects, for clarity. Clarity is the point here: to make the Rust code clearer to inexperienced developers.
